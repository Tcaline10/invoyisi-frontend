## Design Approach

Our system design follows two complementary strategies:

1. **Modular Approach**: The system is decomposed into distinct functional modules with well-defined interfaces, allowing for independent development, testing, and scaling.

2. **Divide-and-Conquer Strategy**: Complex problems are broken down into smaller, manageable sub-problems that can be solved independently and then combined to form the complete solution.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Layered Architecture

The system is organized into four main layers:

- **Client Layer**: User interfaces for different platforms and devices
- **API Gateway Layer**: Unified entry point for all client requests
- **Service Layer**: Core business logic divided into domain-specific microservices
- **Data Layer**: Persistent storage and data management

### 2. Microservices Architecture

The service layer is implemented as a set of microservices, each responsible for a specific domain:

- Invoice Service
- Client Service
- Payment Service
- Document Service
- AI Service
- Notification Service
- Dashboard Service
- Reporting Service

### 3. Database Design

The application uses a relational database (PostgreSQL via Supabase) with a normalized schema design:

- Users table for authentication and user management
- Clients table for client information
- Invoices table for invoice metadata
- Invoice_items table for line items
- Payments table for payment records
- Recurring_invoices table for recurring invoice templates

### 4. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with React and follows a component-based architecture:

- Reusable UI components
- Feature-based organization
- Context API for state management
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### 5. API Design

The API follows RESTful principles and is organized around resources:

- Authentication endpoints
- Client endpoints
- Invoice endpoints
- Payment endpoints
- Document endpoints
- Dashboard endpoints

### 6. Deployment Strategy

The application is deployed using a containerized approach with Kubernetes:

- Docker containers for each service
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment
- Multiple environments (development, staging, production)

## System Diagrams

The documentation includes various diagrams to illustrate different aspects of the system:

- Architecture diagram
- Entity relationship diagram
- Sequence diagrams for key workflows
- Component hierarchy diagram
- Infrastructure diagram

## How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the I-Invoyisi system architecture and design. It can be used by:

- **Developers**: To understand the system components and how they interact
- **DevOps Engineers**: To understand the deployment and infrastructure requirements
- **Product Managers**: To understand the system capabilities and limitations
- **New Team Members**: As an onboarding resource to quickly understand the system

## Maintenance and Updates

This documentation should be kept up-to-date as the system evolves:

1. Update relevant sections when making significant changes to the system
2. Add new diagrams or update existing ones to reflect changes
3. Review the documentation periodically to ensure it remains accurate
